WINDOWS MACHINE.
After starting up the game, press play and follow the instructions on how to control your character.
Those instructions are:
Player 1 may move around with keys: A, D, and jump with W. Player 1 may also punch the other player with the key "S".
Player 2 may move around with keys: LeftArrow, RightArrow, and jump with UpArrow. Player 1 may also punch the other player with the key "DownArrow".

Both players have the ability to "double jump", meaning that while not touching the ground, the player may jump one additional time. This
bonus jump is reset once touching the ground again. 
Both players may also perform a tennis "air hit", by attempting to jump a third time (W key for player 1, and UpArrow for player 2).
This tennis hit actually doesnt make the player move any further up in the air (the plauyer performing the tennis hit),
but allows for the player to hit the other player if the player is right above.

The game objective is to collect 5 coins. The player who collects five coins first wins.
However, if a player is struck by the other player, they loose one coin. Players may not go below zero coins.
The more hits a player takes, the more they will fly away on the map. Coins spawn at random locations around the map and the first player
to touch a coin, recieves it. 

After winning the game, player(s) may exit the game by pressing the "escape" key, which brings up the pause menu and press "quit"
to exit the application.
The pause menu is available during the entirety of the game, and can be used to restart the game.
